This project is the product of a collaboration between myself and the brilliant Shafin Siddique.

# Autocomplete-Engine

An autocompletion engine that can be used in multiple domains such as returning suggestions for a string input from a text file or the autocompletion of songs from a .csv file containing codes for various melodies.

For this project I implemented a new data structure, and then applyied it to two different
problem domains, one of which is a text-based autocompletion tool similar to what online search engines
like Google use.

The Autocompleter Assignment made use of two implementations of a "prefix tree" data structure, which allows clients to autocomplete on text or music from .csv input files. 

To run this project, you will need python 3.0 or grater, and pygame installed.
