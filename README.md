# Autocomplete-Engine
An autocompletion engine that can be used in multiple domains such as returning suggestions for a string input from a text file or the autocompletion of songs from a .csv file containing codes for various melodies.

For this project I implemented a new data structure, and then applyied it to two different
problem domains, one of which is a text-based autocompletion tool similar to what online search engines
like Google use.
